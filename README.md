Minecraft modpack for the Binary Treehouse server

This repo will eventually contain the configuration files and versioning information for the modpack, once I've figured out a nice way to build the modpack without checking in binaries.

A work-in-progress guide for the modpack is available at https://tornewuff.github.io/binary-treehouse and developed on the gh-pages branch of this repository.
